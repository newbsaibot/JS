    <h1>Welcome to Part 8: Your JavaScript Level One Project!</h1>
    <p>For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem to
      ask mundane questions to normal users, but you secretly are looking for
      a spy! Anyone visiting your website will be asked a series of questions,
      only the Spy will be able to give specific answers you expect. If all
      questions are answered correctly, you will post a secret message in console
      for the Spy to read!
   </p>

   <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name</li>
     <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30)</li>
     <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall.</li>
     <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y".</li>
   </ul>



  <p>A spy with the following information should see your secret message:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Leo Cruz</li>
    <li>32 years old</li>
    <li>175 cm tall</li>
    <li>Pet name is "Rhino"</li>
    <li>Pet type is "Dog"</li>
  </ul>
